# LangGraph CAD

LangGraph CAD is a web-based tool for visually designing LangGraph workflows. Built with React and ReactFlow, it provides an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.

## Key Features

- üé® Intuitive drag-and-drop interface
- üîÑ Real-time code generation
- üìù Node name editing
- üîó Conditional edge support
- üíæ Workflow saving/sharing via URL
- üìã Note-taking functionality
- üìã Generated code clipboard copy

## Local installation
U can install your local pc if you want to

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sjkwon1023/langgraph_cad.git
cd langgraph_cad
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

## Usage Guide

### Basic Controls

- **Pan**: Right Click
- **Select Node**: Left click on a node
- **Multiple Selection**: Shift + Left Click
- **Move Node**: Drag the node
- **Delete Node**: Select node and press Delete or Backspace
- **Edit Node Name**: Click the pencil icon after selecting a node

### Adding Nodes

Drag desired node types from the left panel to the workspace:

- **START**: Workflow starting point
- **END**: Workflow ending point
- **Agent**: Agent node
- **Tool**: Tool node
- **Conditional Edge**: Conditional branching edge
- **Text**: Note-taking text node

### Creating Edges

1. Drag from a node's connection point (handle) to another node's handle
2. Adjust the path by dragging the control points after selecting an edge
3. Conditional edges are displayed as dashed lines and processed as conditional branches in code generation

### Code Generation

1. View the generated Python code in the right panel
2. Click "Copy Code" to copy the code
3. Change the graph name in the Graph Name input field

### Workflow Saving

- Current workflow state is automatically saved in the URL
- Click "Copy URL" to copy the current state's URL
- Share the saved URL to let others load the same workflow

## Node Type Descriptions

### START
- Workflow starting point
- Only one START node allowed
- Can have only one output edge

### END
- Workflow ending point
- Only one END node allowed

### Agent
- Agent node
- Main processing step in the workflow
- Can have multiple input and output edges

### Tool
- Tool node
- Performs specific functions
- Can have multiple input and output edges

### Conditional Edge
- Conditional branching node
- This Node is displaying "conditional function"
- Branches to different paths based on input node results
- Displayed as dashed lines and processed as conditional edge in code generation

### Text
- It is a memo
- Not included in code generation

## Important Notes

1. Only one START and one END node can exist.
2. Text nodes are not included in code generation.
3. Workflow must always start from a START node and end at an END node.
4. Conditional edges must be connected through a Conditional Edge node.
